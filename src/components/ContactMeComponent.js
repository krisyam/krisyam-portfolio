            it turned out to be a full-fledged website. `,

        answer: [`Pretty much school is covering everything from Data Analysis, Networking, Programming, and Project Making.`,
            `In the programming side, I've learned Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java, Web Development with a ton of JavaScript Frameworks ie. 
            React and Vue, and the dreaded Mobile Development with React Native.`,

            Being able to explore and do whatever I want is something that I enjoy.
            I have done 90 - 100% completion percentage in Genshin Impact, Fallout 4, Red Dead Redemption, and other games.
            Well... I do still think that Honkai Star Rail is partially open world.`,
            `I also enjoy watching anime and reading manga. 
            I have read through the manga of Dr. Stone, Oshi no Ko, Mushoku Tensei, and some other isekai manga.
            They are really interesting and I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys reading manga.`,
            `But due to the lack of time during my studies, I have not been able to do my hobbies as much as I would like to.
            I'd like to balance my life and work so that I can enjoy my hobbies more.`],

        question: 'What are your plans for further education or certifications?',
        answer: [`I am actually interested in pursuing education in the realm of game development.
            I have always been interested in creating games and I think that it would be a great opportunity to learn more about it.`,
            `Growing interest in learning more about AI and machine learning.
            Especially the youtubers Code Bullet and AI Warehouse, with their videos on AI and machine learning, 
            I have been inspired to learn more about it.`,],
